# Unweb's Privacy Policy

### Effective date: 27th May 2020

Nudgeware ("us", "we", or "our") operates the Unweb browser extension ("Unweb").

Unweb sends data to Amplitude, Inc., an analytics platform (the "Analytics Platform").

This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use Unweb and the choices you have associated with that data.

We use your data to provide and improve Unweb. By using Unweb, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### Information collection and use

We collect information for various purposes to provide and improve Unweb.

### Anonymised IDs and protection of user identity

All data that Unweb collects for a given user is under an anonymised ID (the "ID"), which is a cryptographically generated random string that persists between Chrome sessions and between different Chrome desktop browsers that the the user is signed into with the same Chrome account.

Thus, Unweb cannot identify any given user unless the user themselves provides their ID which they can find on their Options page.

Users can request deletion of their data at any time simply by sending their ID to us over email at feedback@nudgeware.io, using an anonymous email provider if needed to protect their identity.

# Types of data collected

### Regular events:

Unweb will send the following events or information to the Analytics Platform, all linked to the random ID referred to above:

- Initialisation of the Unweb extension
- Initialisation of the Unweb hider script on a page
- Only for domains that Unweb hides: the domain that the Unweb hider script is running on
- Changes of Unweb settings

### Google sign in:

If the user chooses to sign into Unweb with Google, their account will not be linked to the ID mentioned above. All Unweb will receive is the user's email address.

### **Information inferred by the Analytics Platform about the user:**

- IP address.
- Device information (operating system, browser).
- Location information inferred from IP address.

## Unweb's use of the data

Unweb uses the collected data for various purposes:

- To provide and maintain Unweb.
- To notify you about changes to Unweb.
- To provide customer care and support.
- To provide analysis or valuable information so that we can improve Unweb.
- To monitor the usage of Unweb.
- To detect, prevent and address technical issues.
